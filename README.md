A work in progress

Play media content from a blog as a stream.

The hope is that when reading a music blog, the content will be playable as a playlist,
regardless of the source of the content (youtube, soundcloud...).  Currently
only youtube is supported (boo!) and things are very ugly (yay!)

More info to come.
